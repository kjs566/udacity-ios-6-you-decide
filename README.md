# Quarantine Workout - Udacity iOS Nanodegree Project 6
Implementation of my own final projet for iOS - Udacity Nanodegree Program.

# App Description
## Workout with us

App provides user the weekly workout challange, tracking and personal statistics. 
It uses Core Data for storage management, Firebase Auth for authentification and network request downloading of weekly challanges.

# Feature list

* Login - Log in previously created user
* Logout - Logs out from Firebase Auth and return user back to initial screen
* Weekly Challange - Downloads current JSON challange data from API, shows list of exercises
* Workout - Tracking exercises one by one from the challange, warm-up -> exercise <-> rest -> cool-down, storing progress to Core Data
* Workout Results - Results of the previous workout
* My Results - User stats - agregated results from Core Data


## You should not use any of my code inside your Udacity project submission
It would violate the terms of the Udacity and could lead to your ejection from the classes without any refund - read the terms carefully
