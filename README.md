# Quarantine Workout - Udacity iOS Nanodegree Project 6
Implementation of my own final projet for iOS - Udacity Nanodegree Program.

# App Description
## Workout with us

App allowes users to configure, track and evaulate their workout. It uses Core Data for storage management, Firebase Auth for authentification (optional) and network request for downloading weekly chalanges and new workouts.

## You should not use any of my code inside your Udacity project submission
It would violate the terms of the Udacity and could lead to your ejection from the classes without any refund - read the terms carefully

## It's completely fine to use this code as inspiration and/or to help you with any issues you run into with your own project

## Good luck and have fun
